### + Share Drives

Share drives are basically folders that exist on the Domain Controller and are shared with controlled permissions throughout the network.


- **SMB (Server Message Block) folder share**
    : At a high level, SMB communication is easy to understand. SMB clients connect to an SMB server using the SMB port to access SMB shares. Once they access the SMB shares, clients can do things such as collaborate on files without downloading them to their machines or print using a networked printer.
